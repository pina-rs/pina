{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"can't find crate for `num_traits`","code":{"code":"E0463","explanation":"A crate was declared but cannot be found.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0463\nextern crate foo; // error: can't find crate\n```\n\nYou need to link your code to the relevant crate in order to be able to use it\n(through Cargo or the `-L` option of rustc, for example).\n\n## Common causes\n\n- The crate is not present at all. If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`. More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"transfer_sol/src/generated/errors/transfer_sol.rs","byte_start":306,"byte_end":319,"line_start":11,"line_end":11,"column_start":35,"column_end":48,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, Error, FromPrimitive, PartialEq)]","highlight_start":35,"highlight_end":48}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"transfer_sol/src/generated/errors/transfer_sol.rs","byte_start":306,"byte_end":319,"line_start":11,"line_end":11,"column_start":35,"column_end":48,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, Error, FromPrimitive, PartialEq)]","highlight_start":35,"highlight_end":48}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"#[derive(FromPrimitive)]","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/Users/ifiokjr/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/num-derive-0.4.2/src/lib.rs","byte_start":7007,"byte_end":7063,"line_start":242,"line_end":242,"column_start":1,"column_end":57,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"pub fn from_primitive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":57}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: can't find crate for `num_traits`\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0mtransfer_sol/src/generated/errors/transfer_sol.rs:11:35\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m11\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m #[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, Error, FromPrimitive, PartialEq)]\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                   \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m: this error originates in the derive macro `FromPrimitive` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\n\n"}
