Extract POD primitive wrappers into a new publishable `pina_pod_primitives` crate and re-export them from `pina` to preserve API compatibility.

Move `pina_codama_renderer` into `crates/`, update generated Rust clients to depend on `pina_pod_primitives`, reuse instruction docs in rendered output, and remove embedded shared primitive modules.

Add `pina codama generate` for end-to-end Codama IDL/Rust/JS generation with example filtering and configurable JS renderer command.

Expand Codama verification to all examples, move the pnpm workspace to repository root, add CLI snapshot tests with `insta-cmd`, and enforce deterministic regeneration checks for IDLs and generated clients.
