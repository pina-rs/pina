Use `linePrefix:"/// ":true` in all mdt consumer blocks so the `///` prefix is applied to every line, including blank lines. Previously, blank lines within mdt-generated doc comments were left empty, which broke the `///` doc-comment continuity.

Upgraded `mdt_cli` from `0.0.1` (git) to `0.4.0` (crates.io) to gain the `:true` second argument for the `linePrefix` transformer.

Set `wrap_comments = false` in `rustfmt.toml` to prevent rustfmt from reflowing mdt-generated comment lines and splitting HTML closing tags across multiple lines.

Removed unused provider blocks (`pinaPodEndianContract`, `pinaSdkIdModuleContract`) and stale "Generated by mdt." header lines from `api-docs.t.md`.
