Improved release and security hardening with additional example/test coverage:

- Added `cargo-deny` and `cargo-audit` tooling plus `security:deny`, `security:audit`, and `verify:security` commands.
- Added a CI security job and a dependency policy (`deny.toml`) for license/source/dependency-ban enforcement.
- Hardened release workflows by validating `pina_cli` release tags against `crates/pina_cli/Cargo.toml` and scoping binary builds to the `pina_cli` package.
- Expanded docs publishing triggers to include docs changes on `main` and added docs verification in the Pages workflow.
- Added a new `todo_program` example, generated Codama IDL output, and Rust snapshot tests to keep generated IDLs aligned with committed `codama/idls/*.json` artifacts.
