# Security Model

Pina's safety posture is built around explicit validation and predictable state transitions.

## Core invariants

- Type correctness: account bytes must match expected discriminator and layout.
- Authority correctness: signer/owner checks must precede mutation.
- PDA correctness: seed and bump checks must gate PDA-bound operations.
- Value correctness: arithmetic and balance mutations must be checked.

See [ADR 0001](./adrs/0001-discriminator-first-layout.md), [ADR 0002](./adrs/0002-zero-copy-account-model.md), and [ADR 0003](./adrs/0003-guard-backed-typed-account-loaders.md) for the durable rationale behind these invariants.

## Version-safe binary layout and compatibility

The discriminator-first model makes byte layout part of protocol compatibility. Treat every `#[account]` struct as ABI:

- Do not reorder fields.
- Do not change existing discriminator values.
- Do not alter field types in-place without migration.
- If a struct grows, treat it as a new versioned shape and migrate state explicitly.

## Discriminator and payload versioning

| Change                                      | Compatibility impact                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add a new enum variant                      | Usually backward-compatible if old clients ignore unknown variants |
| Change an existing variant value            | **Breaking** for every historical byte slice                       |
| Reorder or remove struct fields             | **Breaking** (offsets change)                                      |
| Append fields to a struct                   | Mostly non-breaking, but consumers must accept the larger size     |
| Switch primitive width (`u8` → `u16`, etc.) | **Breaking** for serialized payloads at that boundary              |

For on-chain accounts, treat layout as part of protocol ABI:

- Keep field order stable.
- Introduce optional `version` fields at the tail for in-place migration strategies.
- Never change existing discriminator values in place.
- When incompatible layout changes are required, perform explicit migration with a new account version and an operator upgrade flow.

For instruction payloads:

- Prefer additive migration: add a new variant and keep legacy handlers for a release cycle.
- Reject stale payload shapes with explicit errors rather than silently reinterpreting bytes.

## High-priority guardrails

- Prefer checked arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`) for all user-facing or balance-affecting values.
- Ensure all token account types used by helper traits implement `AccountValidation`.
- Keep close/transfer helpers conservation-safe (no temporary double-crediting).

## Best practices

<!-- {=pinaSecurityBestPractices} -->

- **Always call `assert_signer()`** before trusting authority accounts
- **Always call `assert_owner()` / `assert_owners()`** before `as_token_*()` methods
- **Always call `assert_empty()`** before account initialization to prevent reinitialization attacks
- **Always verify program accounts** with `assert_address()` / `assert_program()` before CPI invocations
- **Use `assert_type::<T>()`** to prevent type cosplay — it checks discriminator, owner, and data size
- **Use `close_with_recipient()` with `zeroed()`** to safely close accounts and prevent revival attacks
- **Prefer `assert_seeds()` / `assert_canonical_bump()`** over `assert_seeds_with_bump()` to enforce canonical PDA bumps
- **Namespace PDA seeds** with type-specific prefixes to prevent PDA sharing across account types

## Testing strategy

- Unit tests for negative validation cases.
- Regression tests for every previously fixed bug class.
- Integration tests for cross-account invariants where mutation order matters.
