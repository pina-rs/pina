# Security Model

Pina's safety posture is built around explicit validation and predictable state transitions.

## Core invariants

- Type correctness: account bytes must match expected discriminator and layout.
- Authority correctness: signer/owner checks must precede mutation.
- PDA correctness: seed and bump checks must gate PDA-bound operations.
- Value correctness: arithmetic and balance mutations must be checked.

## High-priority guardrails

- Prefer checked arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`) for all user-facing or balance-affecting values.
- Ensure all token account types used by helper traits implement `AccountValidation`.
- Keep close/transfer helpers conservation-safe (no temporary double-crediting).

## Best practices

<!-- {=pinaSecurityBestPractices} -->

- **Always call `assert_signer()`** before trusting authority accounts
- **Always call `assert_owner()` / `assert_owners()`** before `as_token_*()` methods
- **Always call `assert_empty()`** before account initialization to prevent reinitialization attacks
- **Always verify program accounts** with `assert_address()` / `assert_program()` before CPI invocations
- **Use `assert_type::<T>()`** to prevent type cosplay — it checks discriminator, owner, and data size
- **Use `close_with_recipient()` with `zeroed()`** to safely close accounts and prevent revival attacks
- **Prefer `assert_seeds()` / `assert_canonical_bump()`** over `assert_seeds_with_bump()` to enforce canonical PDA bumps
- **Namespace PDA seeds** with type-specific prefixes to prevent PDA sharing across account types

## Testing strategy

- Unit tests for negative validation cases.
- Regression tests for every previously fixed bug class.
- Integration tests for cross-account invariants where mutation order matters.
